1)You have applied K-Means clustering on a dataset of six 2D points with n_clusters=2, random_state=42, and n_init=10. 
Based on the output labels, how did K-Means group the points? Do the assigned clusters align with the data distribution? 
If not, what could be the reason?


2)The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is represented by four features: Sepal Length Sepal Width Petal Length Petal Width.
i)To develop a machine learning model using the Decision tree algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
ii)To develop a machine learning model using the K th cluster algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions. 
iii)To develop a machine learning model using the Random forest algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

OUTPUT: i) Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 1.00 
Prediction for new sample: virginica 
ii)Predicted Cluster: 0 
Prediction for new sample: setosa
iii)Random Forest Model Accuracy: 1.00 
Prediction for new sample: virginica
